I possess an extensive Olympic Games dataset that covers all Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Throughout my project, I tackle 20 unanswered questions by utilizing SQL queries. By analyzing this historical dataset, I uncover insights and provide solutions to long-standing inquiries. From understanding medal distributions to unraveling athlete achievements, my project sheds light on various aspects of the Olympic Games.
